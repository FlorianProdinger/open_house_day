The plan for the open house event is to host a Jupyter Notebooks server on the Raspberry Pi, which can read data from the attached sensors and perform simple data processing and analysis on previously accumulated data.

## Protocol
* Pour the liquid to a cup (drinkable portion, like 150ml to 300ml)
* Put sensors into a cup.
* Wait for 1 min
* read values (see the code for duration/frequency)
* For non-water liquid, wash sensors with tap water (and then sm water)
* Wipe liquid from conductivity sensor (but keep PH sensor wet)
* Repeat the process for other liquids
